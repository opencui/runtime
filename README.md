# Conversational Interface, Declaratively
#

Chatbots are essentially conversational interfaces (CI) to your services. Under ever changing business conditions, be able to go from service to fully functional chatbot quickly is essential. Framely defines a set of dialogue annotations, which CI designer can attach to schema to describe the desired conversational interface declaratively. By focusing on what the conversational interface should be instead of how such behavior can be implemented, effective CI can built efficiently. 

After one annotates the existing schema, it is compiled into a form that Framely dialog engine can interpret to respond to user's message.
